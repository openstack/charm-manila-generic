description: |
  The Manila share file system service provides a set of services for management
  of shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud environment. The service
  resembles OpenStack block-based storage management from the OpenStack Block
  Storage service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can create
  a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then read
  and write data from your instances to and from your file system.

  The manila-generic plugin (using the manila-plugin relation) provides the
  configuration information to the manila charm to configure the Manila
  instance such that it can use the generic driver appropriately.
