# Overview

This charm exists to provide an example backend for Manila, for the purpose
of test and reference.  It is NOT intended for production use in any case.

It configures the generic backend in the related manila charm in an
OpenStack cloud.  This provides NFS shares using Cinder as a backing store.  It
should be used for testing and development purposes only.

# Usage

The charm relies on the principal manila charm, and is a subordinate to it.  It
provides configuration data to the manila-share service (which is provided by
the manila charm with a role that includes 'share').

If multiple, _different_, generic backend configurations are required then the
`share-backend-name` config option should be used to differentiate between the
configuration sections.

_Note_: this subordinate charm requests that manila configure the nova, neutron
and cinder sections that the generic driver needs to launch NFS share instances
that provide NFS/CIFS services within their tenant networks.  The manila charm
provides the _main_ manila service username/password to this charm to enable it
to provide those configuration sections.
